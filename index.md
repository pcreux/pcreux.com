## [CSV Importer](https://github.com/pcreux/csv-importer) - CSV Import for humans on Ruby / Ruby on Rails

## [ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info) - Administration framework for Ruby on Rails

ActiveAdmin helps you build fully featured administration interface.
You can add it to an existing rails application to get a powerful admin UI or build a standalone back office app in days rather than weeks.

## [rspec-set](https://github.com/pcreux/rspec-set) — Speed-up your specs!

rspec-set speeds up integration specs of ActiveRecord models.
It provides a helper called "set" that you use the same
way as "let".
Under the hood, "set" will setup your active record model once and will
take advantage of SQL transactions to rollback all changes made during
each test. Your tests are now _ubber fast_ and still running in isolation.

## [jekyll-s3](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) — Push your jekyll blog to Amazon S3

Amazon S3 is the cheapest and easiest way to serve a jekyll blog. jekyll-s3 (now s3_website) is the easiest way to push your jekyll blog to Amazon S3.

## [active_sanity](https://github.com/versapay/active_sanity) — Sanity check your database

all invalid Active Records your database contain. Run it, fix your records and
sleep better at night.

## [bundler-auto-update](https://github.com/versapay/bundler-auto-update) — Auto-magi-safely update your Gemfile

[bundler-auto-update](https://github.com/pcreux/bundler-auto-update) update all the gems listed in your Gemfile to
the latest version that does not break your tests.

## [git-branch-delete-orphans](https://github.com/pcreux/git-branch-delete-orphans) — Delete orphan branches
