## [Healthy Codebase and Preparatory Refactoring](http://brewhouse.io/blog/2014/11/10/healthy-codebase-and-preparatory-refactoring.html) - November 2014

In a recent episode of the RubyRogues podcast, Martin Fowler and Jessica
Kerr literally spoke my mind. They named two concepts that I deeply
believe in and care about: Healthy Codebase and Preparatory Refactoring.
The fact that they have expressed them in beautiful words and powerful
metaphors enables me to share them with you in this article.

## [Gourmet Service objects](http://brewhouse.io/blog/2014/04/30/gourmet-service-objects.html) - April 2014

Is your Rails app’s business logic hidden in ugly controllers with 10+
lines long method and fat models powered by Linguini callbacks? Are your
tests getting out of control and you spend most of your days looking at
green dots? Do you want to impress your coworkers with Unicorn level
code? You need Gourmet Service Objects™!

## [ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info) - Administration framework for Ruby on Rails

ActiveAdmin helps you build fully featured administration interface.
You can add it to an existing rails application to get a powerful admin UI or build a standalone back office app in days rather than weeks.

## [rspec-set](https://github.com/pcreux/rspec-set) — Speed-up your specs!

rspec-set speeds up integration specs of ActiveRecord models.
It provides a helper called "set" that you use the same
way as "let".
Under the hood, "set" will setup your active record model once and will
take advantage of SQL transactions to rollback all changes made during
each test. Your tests are now _ubber fast_ and still running in isolation.

## [jekyll-s3](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) — Push your jekyll blog to Amazon S3

Amazon S3 is the cheapest and easiest way to serve a jekyll blog. jekyll-s3 (now s3_website) is the easiest way to push your jekyll blog to Amazon S3.

all invalid Active Records your database contain. Run it, fix your records and
sleep better at night.
