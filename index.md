Hello, my name is Philippe Creux.

I am a Software Developer based in Vancouver, BC. I deeply care about shipping software that’s simple, robust and cost-effective.

I build healthy software at [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com) to *help bring creative projects to life*.

I’ve been sharing my learnings and practices on various blog posts and built several open source projects.

I am currently running the [Vancouver Ruby meet-up](http://vanruby.org). Prior to that, I ran the meet-ups [Lyon.rb](http://lyonrb.fr) and [Agile Valence](http://groupspaces.com/CARAValence), hosted the podcast [Parlons Ruby](http://parlonsruby.com) and co-organized the [Ruby Lyon Conference 2012](http://2012.rulu.eu).
