Nice Properties:
* you can reconstruct the state at any point in time.
* you can reconstruct the state up to a certain point in time. Time machine!
* full history

---

## Events Metadata

1. `Task Created`
  * `title: "Prepare sides"`
  * `event.created_at: "2019-04-15"`
  * `event.user: "Caroline"`
  * `event.device: "Desktop"`
  * `event.ip: "92.43.x.x"`
2. `Task Due Date Set`
  * `date: "2019-04-20"`
  * `event.created_at: "2019-04-15"`
  * `event.device: "Desktop"`
  * `event.ip: "92.43.x.x"`

...

* `Task Completed`
  * `event.created_at: "2019-04-29"`
  * `event.user: "Philippe"`
  * `event.device: "Pixel 3"`
  * `event.ip: "82.23.x.x"`

???

* Events have metadata associated to them.
* Thanks to the disconnect between the Application State Data and the Event Data
we can store data that we don't need right now but might be useful in the future.

# You use Event Sourcing everyday!

???

* git
** working directory is the current state
** commits are events
** travel back and forth, branch out (what if scenarios...?)

* business people
** accounting ledger
** bank statement: current balance  full history

---
class: center,middle

# Key Benefits

---

class: center,middle

# Full history / audit log

## We understand how we got there

???

* Make supports easier
* Make debugging easier. ex: unbounce subscription

---

class: center,middle

# Replay events...

## to backfill a new attribute

???

* events has a lot of data and metadata
* when adding a new attribute to the application state
* you can replay events to backfill that attribute with data

---

class: center,middle

# Replay events...

## to recover lost records

???

* a record has been deleted by mistake?
* you can replay events to get it back!

---

class: center,middle

# Replay events...

## to fix inconsistent state

???

* a bug in your code
* a race condition
* or a data migration that went bad can lead
to an inconsistent state

* by replaying events you can get back to a sane state

---

class: center,middle

# Replay events...

## to travel back in time

???

* replay events up to a certain point in time... and you have a time machine.

---

class: center,middle

# Forward events...

## to your datawarehouse

???

* events are first class citizens of you system
* rather than writing custom code to send events to a datawarehouse
* forward them as is

---

class: center,middle

# Forward events...

## to your monitoring solution

???

* track application level metrics
* raise alerts when such metric (checkouts!) is low

---

class: center,middle

# Apply events...

## to build tailored projections

ActivityFeed, Daily Report etc.

???

* We call the Main representation of an entity an aggregate: Task, Subscription, User, Post
* Other represenations that are tailored to a specific usage or a specific type of user. Great high read / fast read application

---

class: center,middle

# Existing event can be used to...

## backfill your datawarehouse tables

???

* Not only you can backfill new attributes / columns
* you can backfill the datawarehouse tables as well
* it's simple function to transform event into a datawarehouse event
* so you can also re-ingest all the events if something went wrong in the transformation

---

class: center,middle

# Existing event can be used to...

## backfill your new ActivityFeed feature from Day 1.

???

* When you release a new feature such as an activity feed, you tend to only log activity items from the day that you released the feature...
* or have to write custom code

---

# Great fit for distributed systems
???

* evnent as source of truth - first class citizens are great for distributed systems
* async communication
* eventual consitency
* micro services and the like.
* But you don't have to have such an architecture to benefit from such an architecture.

# Great fit for distributed systems

# Event Sourcing at Kickstarter
## making it simple

class: middle

# https://d.rip
## A subscription platform to support creators

---

# Event Sourcing Framework

## Requirements

* Must be simple to learn and use
* Must be easy to remove

## Solution

* Custom "framework" ~150 LOC
* Events are regular ActiveRecord models
* Only change the way we mutate data

  class AddCompletedAtToTasks < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
    def up
      add_column 'tasks', :completed_at, :datetime

      # Replay events

        task.events.reduce(task) do |task, event|

      end

      remove_column 'tasks', :completed

???

On a real / live system, this would be a 5 steps process:

1. add new column
2. make the event write to both the old and the new column
3. replay events
4. stop writing to the old column
5. remove the old column

# Side-effects performed by Reactors

---

# Introducing Reactors

* Reactors are triggered when an event is **created**
* They can be associated with one or many event types
* They can run synchronously or async

Usage:

* They are used to trigger side effects
* They can create other events in turn

---

# Let's add email notifications

```ruby
class Events::Dispatcher < BaseDispatcher
  # ...
  on Events::Task::Completed, trigger: Reactors::Task::NotifyCompleted
  # ...
end
```

```ruby
module Reactors
  module Task
    NotifyCompleted = ->(event) do
      if event.user != event.task.author
        TaskMailer.queue_task_completed(task: event.task)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

---

# ... and some event tracking

```ruby
class Events::Dispatcher < BaseDispatcher
  # ...
  on Events::Task::Completed, trigger: Reactors::Task::NotifyCompleted
  on Events::Task::Completed, trigger: Reactors::ForwardEvent
  # ...
end
```

```ruby
module Reactors
  ForwardEvent = ->(event) do
    attributes = event.data.merge(event.metadata)
    EventBus.track_event(event.class.name, attributes)
  end
end
```

---

# ... and an activity feed

```ruby
class Events::Dispatcher < BaseDispatcher
  # ...
  on Events::Task::Completed, trigger: Reactors::Task::NotifyCompleted
  on Events::Task::Completed, trigger: Reactors::ForwardEvent
  on Events::Task::Completed, trigger: Reactors::CreateActivityEntry
  # ...
end
```

```ruby
module Reactors
  CreateActivityEntry = ->(event) do
    Activity.create!(
      subject: event.aggregate,
      user_id: event.metadata["user_id"],
      recorded_at: event.created_at,
      action: event.class.name.demodulize.underscore
    )
  end
end
```

---

# Tracking all the things

```ruby
# Inheritance
Events::BaseEvent <- Events::Task::BaseEvent <- Events::Task::Completed
```

```ruby
class Events::Dispatcher < BaseDispatcher
  # ...
  on Events::Task::Completed, trigger: Reactors::Task::NotifyCompleted
  on Events::BaseEvent, trigger: Reactors::ForwardEvent
  on Events::Task::BaseEvent, trigger: Reactors::CreateActivityEntry
  # ...
end
```

# Run reactors asynchronously via ActiveJob

```ruby
class Events::Dispatcher < BaseDispatcher

  on Events::BaseEvent, async: Reactors::ForwardEvent
  on Events::Task::BaseEvent, async: Reactors::CreateActivityEntry

# 1 year of Event Sourcing on https://d.rip

## Code

* 15 aggregates
* 135 events
* 60 reactors

## Data

* ~100k aggregate records
* ~500k event records

???

Might want to remove those.

Have a full audit-log such as this one is great for:

* customer support
* debugging on production
* debugging in dev or test environment
* track down race conditions

Ex: subscription status mismatch

# Monitor all the things!

???

* We use a combination of Statsd + Grafana + InfluxDB for monitoring.
* All events are sent to Statsd so that
* We can start monitoring any event - the data is there

---

# Report on all the things!

???

* We use a combination of Kinesis + Redshift + Looker for business analytics.
* All events are sent to our Redshift cluster
* started to send events to the Redshift Cluster 6 month after going private-beta
* we were able to backfill the datawarehouse with all the events since the beginning of time

# Side effects at a glance

???

* DSL to connect reactors to events
* Reactors only create other events in turn
* All that chain is logged in events metadata so you can trace
the chain of effects that one event has introduced

# Data you **write** != Data you **read**

## Persist everything in Events
## Surface what you need in Aggregates

You don't need to make trade offs anymore when designing

# Naming is hard

## With immutable events, names are final.

# Updating event schemas is _(surprisingly)_ not a big deal

# Updating event schemas is _(surprisingly)_ not a big deal
## New attributes tend to have an implicit default value

* For example, adding `currency`. Default to `USD`.

# Event Sourcing Made Simple

---

# Event Sourcing

* The application state is the result of a sequence of events
* Events hold data and metadata available at the time of creation
* Reactors trigger side effects - and can create events


## Key Benefits

* Full history and audit log
* Backfilling
* Fixing bugs is easier - less risk of losing data
* Events can be forwarded at (almost) no additional cost
